# Thanksgiving Party

Thanksgiving Party is a game in the style of Wolfenstein 3D where you fight turkeys that are really angry.

On the main menu, you can choose between three levels of difficulty (Easy, Normal, Hard) which influences the speed and damage of turkeys.
You can also manage the sounds volume chosing between None, Low and Normal. Finally, click on Help will show keyboards controls.

Kill all the turkeys to win, at the end, a leaderboard will save your result if you killed all the turkeys in a short time. In game, you'll encounter closed doors, so you'll have to find keys to open these. You'll lose if you waste all of your health points.
