1. You need to install  opencv(project was made with 4.8.0 version), SDL(project was made with 2.26.3 version) and SFML(project was made with 2.6.0 version) libraries to C:/ folder
2. You can use this project as 2 separated games(one in ConsoleApplication4-pseudo-doom folder another in ConsoleApplication4-pseudo-doom/Project7/Project7 folder)
or you can firstly open 2d game(Project7) gain bullets there and after open 2.5D game(ConsoleApplication4-pseudo-doom) and you will have the number of bullets from your previous game, which has been multiplied by a factor depending on the number of lives you have left by the end of the last game
GOOD GAME
